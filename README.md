# Headless WordPress

In short, Headless WordPress simply means “No WordPress front-end.” Companies who use an entirely Headless solution will typically host a separate JavaScript application for the front-end, which pulls specific WordPress data via the REST API.

# Brainless WordPress

Using WordPress functionality and the REST API in tandem. While Headless “consumes” data from WordPress, Brainless actually uses WordPress when building the front-end. Brainless implementations use WordPress to compile minimal HTML and static assets upon the initial page request. It then allows JavaScript to construct the entirety of the front-end while consuming data from the REST API.
